# makes

This directory contains the make files that will build robot code for a simulation rather than a robot

Sike no it doesnt ~/VEX/SmallRobot/ is the test project that has the most up to date ones 

2/3/23
up to the point that it finds all libs it needs except for v5 lib cuz i havent written that yet
```
ld: skipping incompatible /home/richie/VEX/Sim/sdk/sim_vexv5/libv5rt.a when searching for -lv5rt
ld: cannot find -lv5rt: No such file or directory
```

takes libmath and stdlib from normal system places
